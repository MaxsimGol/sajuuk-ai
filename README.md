# Sajuuk AI

A StarCraft II bot built with a hybrid development approach, combining human architecture with AI-assisted implementation.

## The Mission

This is a personal project to explore two of my passions: programming and games. The goal isn't just to build a bot, but to document an experiment: can a solo hobbyist developer collaborate with a large language model (Google's Gemini) to create a competitive AI?

This repository tracks that journey.

## The Hybrid Development Model: Maksim & Gemini

The core of this project is its development methodology. It's a partnership with clearly defined roles:

*   **Maksim (The Architect & Verifier):** I am responsible for the high-level design, the core architecture, and the strategic roadmap. Most importantly, I define every task in a granular way and **personally verify every single line of code** generated by the AI before it is integrated. I am the final gatekeeper for quality and correctness.

*   **Gemini (The Coder & Implementer):** Gemini acts as a powerful pair-programmer. It takes small, well-defined prompts from me and generates the implementation code. Its role is to handle the boilerplate and tactical coding, accelerating the development process.

## Core Architecture: The "Race General" Pattern

The bot's design is focused on maintainability and preventing technical debt. The core philosophy is a "Race General" pattern:

*   **Strict Separation:** Logic for Zerg, Terran, and Protoss is kept in completely isolated "silos." No race-specific code is allowed to cross-contaminate another.
*   **Delegation:** A central "Conductor" class detects the race at the start of the game and delegates all control to a race-specific "General" (e.g., `ZergGeneral`).


## Technology Stack

*   **Language:** Python 3.10+
*   **Core Library:** [burnysc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2)
*   **AI Assistance:** Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (via API)

## About Me

My name is Maksim. Programming is my hobby, and I've always wanted to build a bot for  StarCraft II. This project is my exploration of how to make that happen by partnering with the new generation of AI tools.
